# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## The challenge

In this challenge, I built a FAQ accordion, aiming to make it as close to the original design as possible.

The goal was to create a responsive interface where users can:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
