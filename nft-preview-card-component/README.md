# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## The challenge

In this challenge, I built a preview card component, aiming to make it as close to the original design as possible.

The goal was to create a responsive interface where users can:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
